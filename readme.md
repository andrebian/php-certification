# PHP Certification


This repository was created with the intention to guide my personal study plan for my PHP Certification.

All of the examples are based on official study guide. You can buy this study guide in the following address:
https://www.zend.com/en/services/certification/php-certification-study-guide  

> **Important**: Don't try to find an illegal study guide on the web. This is an investment in YOUR career, pay for it!

As following the study guide, for any topic I consider need, I will create a PHP file with some examples and comments.
